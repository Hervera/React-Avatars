The application consists of:
1. A form which allows the user to upload his/her photo and be converted into an avatar
   - Take inspiration on how many sites allow users to upload their avatars. E.g. Drag and drop

2. A list of avatars displayed in upload date order
   - Once an avatar is uploaded it will directly be displayed on the page
